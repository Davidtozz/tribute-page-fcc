                The Early Days: Origins of Cybersecurity in the 1960s and 70s

            <p>
                During the early days of computing in the 1960s and 70s, 
                cybersecurity was not a major concern. Computer systems were 
                mainly used by large organizations and governments, and security 
                was not considered to be a significant issue. However, as computing
                became more widespread, so did the need to protect these systems 
                from unauthorized access.
